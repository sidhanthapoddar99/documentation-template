# documentation-template

Astro-based documentation framework with modular layouts, YAML configuration, a folder-per-issue tracker, and live editing via Yjs CRDT. Ships its own Claude Code plugin so authoring docs is one slash command away.

## Quick start

The fastest path is via the bundled Claude Code plugin — three commands to install, one to scaffold:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/sidhanthapoddar99/documentation-template
/plugin install documentation-guide@documentation-template
/reload-plugins
/docs-init
```

`/docs-init` walks you through site name, first section, and patches `CLAUDE.md`. At the end it prints the framework-clone command tailored to your scope choice. Open `http://localhost:4321` and you have a docs site.

> [!note]
> Local install while iterating? Use a plain absolute path (no `file://` prefix) for the marketplace add: `/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/this/repo`.

## What's in the plugin

| Surface | Use it for |
|---|---|
| **Skill** — `documentation-guide` | Triggers automatically on any docs/issue/blog/config work. Triages to one of five domain-specific reference files. |
| **Slash commands** — `/docs-init`, `/docs-add-section` | Bootstrap a new project; add a top-level section. Both interactive. |
| **CLI wrappers (8)** for the issue tracker | `docs-list`, `docs-show`, `docs-subtasks`, `docs-agent-logs`, `docs-set-state`, `docs-add-comment`, `docs-add-agent-log`, `docs-review-queue` |
| **Validators (3)** — exit `0` clean / `1` on errors | `docs-check-blog`, `docs-check-config`, `docs-check-section <folder>` |

All 11 wrappers land on your `$PATH` automatically after install — no path configuration. Pass `--help` to any of them for the full flag list.

## Manual setup (without `/docs-init`)

The framework supports two operating modes — pick the one that matches your situation.

### Consumer mode (recommended for new projects)

You have a project (a repo, a folder, anything) and you want docs alongside your code or content. Clone the framework as a **subfolder** named `documentation-template/`, write your own `config/`/`data/`/`assets/`/`themes/` next to it at the project root, and point `.env` (inside the framework folder) back up to your content.

```bash
cd <your-project>
git clone https://github.com/sidhanthapoddar99/documentation-template.git
# Author your config/, data/, assets/, themes/ at the project root
# (or run /docs-init to scaffold them from the bundled template).
cd documentation-template
echo "CONFIG_DIR=../config" > .env
./start                            # http://localhost:4321
```

The framework folder is treated as a vendored dependency — you don't edit anything inside `documentation-template/`. Your content lives outside it.

### Dogfood / framework-dev mode (working *on* the framework itself)

This is what running this repo directly does — you're hacking on the framework, with `default-docs/` doubling as both the framework's own docs and the testbed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidhanthapoddar99/documentation-template.git
cd documentation-template
cp .env.example .env               # CONFIG_DIR=./default-docs/config (dogfood default)
./start
```

`./start` is a thin wrapper at the framework folder root: it detects `bun` (falls back to `npm`), installs dependencies on first run, runs a build sanity check, then starts the dev server.

For a deeper walkthrough (folder layout, what each path means, when to use which mode), see the user-guide: [Installation](https://github.com/sidhanthapoddar99/documentation-template/blob/main/default-docs/data/user-guide/05_getting-started/02_installation.md), [Environment Variables](https://github.com/sidhanthapoddar99/documentation-template/blob/main/default-docs/data/user-guide/10_configuration/02_env.md), [Init and the Starter Template](https://github.com/sidhanthapoddar99/documentation-template/blob/main/default-docs/data/user-guide/05_getting-started/06_init-and-template.md).

## Build commands

From the repo root, use the `./start` wrapper:

```bash
./start          # preflight (install + build check) then dev server
./start dev      # dev server with hot reload
./start build    # production build → astro-doc-code/dist/
./start preview  # preview production build locally
./start <script> # forward any package.json script
```

Inside `astro-doc-code/`, the usual `bun run dev` / `bun run build` / `bun run preview` still work directly.

    ├── config/                         ← site.yaml, navbar.yaml, footer.yaml

    └── data/                           ← user-guide, dev-docs, blog, todo (the framework's own docs)
```

`default-docs/` is the framework's **own** content — its user-guide, its dev-docs, its sample blog/issues, its bundled themes — packaged with the install. **Consumers don't edit it.** When you use the framework via consumer mode (clone as a subfolder), you write your content at YOUR project root (in `config/`, `data/`, `assets/`, `themes/` next to the framework folder), and `default-docs/` stays read-only as a vendored dependency. In dogfood mode (this repo), `default-docs/` doubles as both the framework's own docs and the live testbed for any framework changes.

The repo is **both** the marketplace and the plugin source — a dogfood setup. The same install command above is what every consumer (and every clone of this repo) runs.

## Documentation

- **End-user docs** — `default-docs/data/user-guide/` (rendered at `/user-guide` in the live site). Setup, configuration, content authoring, themes, layouts, the issue tracker.
- **Developer docs** — `default-docs/data/dev-docs/` (rendered at `/dev-docs`). Architecture, layouts internals, loader pipeline, scripts, and the **Plugins** section explaining how Claude Code plugins work and how to author one.
- **CLAUDE.md** at the repo root — orientation for Claude Code sessions working in this repo.

## What's coming

The framework currently ships via `git clone`. A planned refactor (`2026-04-25-framework-as-npm-package` issue) packages it as a published `bun add documentation-template` dependency, so each consumer becomes a thin shell over the engine instead of a full clone. Once that lands, `/docs-init` will install the engine via npm/bun instead of asking you to clone.

## License

TBD — placeholder. Pick before public distribution.
