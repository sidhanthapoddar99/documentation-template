## Common Mistakes

### Missing Date

The `date` field is required for proper sorting:

```yaml
# Wrong - missing date
---
title: My Post
---

# Correct
---
title: My Post
date: 2024-01-15
---
```

### Invalid Date Format

Use `YYYY-MM-DD` format:

```yaml
# Wrong formats
date: 01/15/2024
date: January 15, 2024
date: 15-01-2024

# Correct format
date: 2024-01-15
```

### Inconsistent Tags

Use the same tag format throughout:

```yaml
# Inconsistent - avoid
tags: [TypeScript, type-script, TYPESCRIPT]

# Consistent - good
tags: [typescript]
```
