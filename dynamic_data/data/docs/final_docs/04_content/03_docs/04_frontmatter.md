# Docs Frontmatter

Every documentation file (`.md` or `.mdx`) should include frontmatter at the top. Frontmatter is YAML metadata enclosed in triple dashes.

## Basic Structure

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: Brief description for SEO
---

# Page Title

Content starts here...
```

## Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `title` | `string` | Page title (appears in sidebar and browser tab) |

## Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `description` | `string` | `""` | SEO meta description |
| `sidebar_label` | `string` | `title` | Override text shown in sidebar |
| `draft` | `boolean` | `false` | Hide page in production builds |
| `tags` | `string[]` | `[]` | Tags for search indexing |

## Field Details

### `title` (Required)

```yaml

---
```

### `sidebar_label`

Override the sidebar text without changing the page title.

```yaml

### `tags`

Add tags for search indexing and categorization.

## Common Mistakes

### Missing Dashes

Frontmatter must be enclosed in triple dashes:

```yaml
---
title: Correct
---
```

Not:

```yaml
title: Wrong (no dashes)
```

### Incorrect YAML Syntax

Watch out for colons in values:

```yaml
# Wrong - unquoted colon
---
title: API: Getting Started
---

# Correct - quoted string
---
title: "API: Getting Started"
---
```

### Title vs H1 Mismatch

Keep your frontmatter title and H1 heading consistent:

```yaml
---
title: Installation Guide
---

# Installation Guide

Content...
```
