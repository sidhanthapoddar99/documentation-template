# Writing Documentation

Documentation files are MD or MDX files stored in `DATA_DIR/data/docs/`. This section covers everything you need to know to create well-organized documentation.

## Quick Reference

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [File Structure](/docs/content/writing-docs/file-structure) | Naming conventions with `XX_` prefix |
| [Folder Settings](/docs/content/writing-docs/folder-settings) | Configure `settings.json` for each folder |
| [Frontmatter](/docs/content/writing-docs/frontmatter) | Required and optional metadata fields |
| [Assets](/docs/content/writing-docs/assets) | Embed code, images, and videos |
| [Content Syntax](/docs/content/writing-docs/content-syntax) | Markdown and MDX writing guide |

## Key Rules Summary

1. **All files and folders must have `XX_` prefix** (01-99)
2. **Every folder needs `settings.json`** (except root doc folder)
3. **Every file needs frontmatter** with at least `title`
4. **Assets folder is excluded** from sidebar indexing
5. **Use `[[type, path]]` syntax** for easy asset embedding

## Supported File Types

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `.md` | Standard Markdown |
| `.mdx` | Markdown with JSX components |

Both formats support frontmatter, code blocks, tables, and all standard Markdown features. MDX additionally supports importing and using React/Astro components.
