# Agent Log

The `agent-log/` folder holds an audit trail of AI iterations on an issue. Each file is one iteration: what was attempted, what happened, what's next. Failed iterations are kept — they're as informative as successes. When a human reviews a `review`-flagged issue, the agent log is the first thing they read.

This is one of the two features that make the tracker AI-native. Without it, long-running autonomous work is opaque; with it, every iteration is inspectable.

## File naming

```
agent-log/
├── 001_initial-triage.md
├── 002_incremental-parse-spike.md
├── 003_cache-inspector-hookup.md
└── exploration/                       ← one level of subgroup allowed
    ├── 001_approach-a.md
    └── 002_approach-b.md
```

- **`NNN`** — sequence number (1-indexed). Zero-padding optional but recommended.
- **Separator** — `_` or `-` (both work).
- **Slug** — kebab-case, human-readable, describes the iteration's focus.

Sequence numbers are **per folder** — inside `agent-log/` top-level they start at 001; inside a subgroup like `exploration/` they restart at 001.

### Subgroups (one level deep)

An agent exploring multiple approaches can create subgroup folders:

```
agent-log/
├── 001_initial-triage.md
├── exploration/
│   ├── 001_approach-a.md
│   └── 002_approach-b.md
└── implementation/
    ├── 001_spike.md
    └── 002_final.md
```

The loader supports exactly **one level** of subgroup. Anything deeper (`agent-log/a/b/…`) produces a warning and is ignored. Keep the tree shallow.

## Frontmatter

```markdown
---
iteration: 3
agent: claude-opus-4-6
status: success
date: 2026-04-21

# Iteration 3 — restructure comprehensive view

## Goal

Eliminate heading-ID collisions between subtasks when rendered together on the
Comprehensive tab.

## Approach

…

## Result

…

## Next

…
```

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `iteration` | int | Sequential counter. Falls back to filename sequence if absent. |
| `agent` | string | Which agent / model wrote this (e.g. `claude-opus-4-6`, `gpt-4`, `human:sidhantha`) |
| `status` | string | Free-form: `in-progress`, `success`, `failed`, `abandoned`, `handed-off`, … |
| `date` | ISO date | When this iteration ran |

All optional. The loader degrades gracefully when fields are missing.

## Body structure — the 4-section convention

Not enforced by the loader, but **strongly recommended** for every entry. This shape is what makes the log useful under review:

```markdown
## Goal
What was being attempted in this iteration.

## Approach
The plan / strategy. What files were going to be touched, what hypotheses
were being tested.

## Result
What actually happened. Include evidence — file paths that changed, tests
that passed / failed, commits made. Enough that a reviewer can verify
without re-running everything.

## Next
What to try next (if failed / in-progress), or "done, handed off for review"
if success.
```

The point is to leave a trail future iterations (and human reviewers) can read **in order**, rapidly catching up on what's been tried.

## Rules of the road

### Keep failed iterations

Do not delete. A failed iteration with a clear `Result` + `Next` tells the next iteration what not to do. Deleting it forces the next agent to rediscover the failure.

### One file per iteration, not per minute

An iteration is "I attempted approach X; here's what happened." If you're writing three files a minute, they're not iterations — they're thoughts. Consolidate.

### New iteration = new file, not an edit

Don't rewrite `003_spike.md` to describe what happened in iteration 4. Add `004_refinement.md`. Git history then tells a clean story.

### Read the log before starting work

When picking up an issue with existing agent logs, **read them all first** (the planned helper script `scripts/issues/agent-logs.mjs --last 5` will make this cheap). Otherwise you'll repeat failed approaches.

### Close out on `closed`

When the human flips the issue from `review → closed`, the agent's next pickup should write a final entry summarising the shipped state — commit hash, PR number, what landed. Leaving dangling "in-progress" entries makes the log feel live when it isn't.

## Rendering

- **Detail page left sidebar** — each agent log file is linked, with status indicator next to the title.
- **Comprehensive tab** — agent logs render in a dedicated section below notes, in sequence order, grouped by subgroup where present. Each log's headings get ID-prefixed.

Separate per-log URLs are planned — tracked in `2026-04-10-issues-layout/subtasks/17_subdoc-separate-urls.md`.

## Example: a completed log

```
agent-log/
├── 001_initial-triage.md                          status: success
├── 002_incremental-parse-spike.md                 status: failed
├── 003_cache-invalidation-approach.md             status: success
└── 004_shipped-closing-summary.md                 status: success
```

Iteration 1 — scoped the problem. Iteration 2 — tried incremental parsing, didn't work (log captures why). Iteration 3 — alternative approach worked. Iteration 4 — human flipped to `closed`, final summary written. Full story, readable in 4 files.

## When NOT to write to the log

- **Human edits** — comments belong in `comments/`, not agent-log. The log is for programmatic writes during autonomous runs.
- **Micro-progress pings** — "I ran the test, it passed" isn't a worthwhile iteration. Batch into the next meaningful log.
- **Editing old entries** — don't rewrite history. Add a new entry.
