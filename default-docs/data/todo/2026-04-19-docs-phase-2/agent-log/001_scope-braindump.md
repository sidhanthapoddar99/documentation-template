# Scope braindump — verbatim + structured interpretation

## Structured interpretation

Read as: "Here's what phase-2 added, and here's how the *information architecture* of our docs needs to change — split cleanly between user-guide (audience: people writing docs) and dev-docs (audience: people working on the codebase)."

### 1. Cross-cutting items (appear in both guides)

**Theme system** — phase 2 introduced a standardization pass across sizing and colour: a required-variables contract, a two-tier token model (primitives vs semantic UI/content/display tiers), no invented names, no hardcoded fallbacks.

- *User-guide angle*: the theme **config** page — how users pick / author a theme using the declared tokens.
- *Dev-docs angle*: the **standardization rationale** — why the contract exists, how layouts consume it, the mistakes it prevents.

**Config audit** — phase 2 moved / added config surfaces. Sweep `site.yaml`, `navbar.yaml`, `footer.yaml`, tracker `settings.json`, and flag anything the user-guide config section doesn't yet cover.

### 2. User-guide restructure

The user guide should be read by someone who has zero intent to touch backend or frontend code — just write content. So:

**Drop from user-guide**: code structure, project structure, any "how the backend works" material. Move that into dev-docs.

**Keep / emphasize in user-guide**: how to write content, how to pick and configure a layout, Claude skills.

**New top-level IA for user-guide:**

1. **Writing Content** — markdown conventions, frontmatter, custom tags, editing via the live editor. Layout mechanics *leave* this section.
2. **Layout System** — a simple overview: what a layout is, its config/settings, the four types (docs / blog / issues / custom), how they're structured at a glance.
3. **Docs** — authoring docs layouts.
4. **Blogs** — authoring blog layouts.
5. **Issues** — purpose, folder-per-item data model, why it's AI-native (subtasks/notes/agent-log are machine-writable + human-readable).
6. **Custom** — custom / marketing / landing layouts.

The point is: Docs / Blogs / Issues / Custom each become top-level sections instead of being buried under a generic "layouts" section.

### 3. Dev-docs restructure

The dev-docs are read by someone working on the framework itself. They should *not* duplicate the "how to write docs" material from the user-guide. They should:

- Explain the basic structural rules the codebase follows.
- Explain how data is parsed end-to-end.
- Cover internal doc structure conventions.
- Point at config settings from the *implementation* angle (what each surface controls, how it's loaded).
- Explicitly *not* cover Claude skills (that's user-facing).

**Open with a top-level component map** so a reader can orient before drilling in:

1. Overall architecture
2. Parsers
3. Routing system
4. Layout system
5. Caching system
6. Scripts
7. Dev toolkits
8. Optimizations
9. Theme system

### 4. Dev tools (dev-docs chapter)

Three items:

1. The two new toolbar apps — **system-metrics** (RAM / CPU) and **cache-inspector** (Yjs rooms, editor docs, presence). What they show, how to read it.
2. The new **`src/dev-tools/` folder-per-tool layout** and the `_shared/` common layer (CSS tokens now, formatters / types likely next).
3. The **live editor** gets lifted out as its own standalone module — deliberately *not* re-scoped into this docs-update pass, because it's large enough to warrant its own issue.

### 5. Deferred / explicit non-goals for this issue

- Rewriting the live-editor documentation (separate module / separate issue).
- Documenting phase-3 features (search, plugin system) that haven't landed.
- Auto-generating API reference.

## Does this make sense? → yes

The core move is: **split audiences cleanly** (writer vs. maintainer), **flatten the layout IA** in the user guide (each content type becomes its own top-level section instead of a sub-node under "layouts"), and **lead dev-docs with a component map** so the shape of the codebase is visible before any one file is.

Next step (pending user sign-off): expand each bullet under "Quick subtasks" in `issue.md` into a proper subtask file under `subtasks/`, with done flags and explicit before/after diffs for the affected pages.
