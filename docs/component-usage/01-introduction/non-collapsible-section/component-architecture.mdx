# Component Architecture

Learn about the component structure and organization principles.

## Directory Structure

```
src/components/
├── elements/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── Button/
│   ├── Card/
│   └── Grid/
├── homepage/         # Page-specific components
└── roadmap/          # Feature-specific components
```

## Component Pattern

Each component follows this structure:

```
ComponentName/
├── ComponentName.js    # Main component logic
├── ComponentName.css   # Component styles
└── index.js           # Export file
```

## Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should do one thing well
2. **Props Interface**: Define clear prop types
3. **Composition**: Build complex UIs from simple components
4. **Performance**: Use React.memo for expensive components
