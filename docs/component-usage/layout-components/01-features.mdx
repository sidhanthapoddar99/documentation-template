## Styling

The Features component uses CSS Grid with automatic responsive behavior:

- Automatically adjusts to screen size
- Consistent gap between items
- Hover effects on feature cards

### Theme Variables Used

- `--theme-card-bg`: Card background
- `--theme-card-border`: Card border
- `--theme-card-hover`: Hover border color
- `--theme-icon-filter`: Icon color filter for dark mode

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent icons**: Use either all emojis or all image icons
2. **Concise descriptions**: Keep descriptions brief and impactful
3. **Logical grouping**: Group related features together
4. **Responsive testing**: Test on mobile to ensure readability
5. **Icon size**: Emojis work best at 1.5rem, images at 32x32px
