# Directory Structure

Understanding the Docusaurus directory structure is essential for organizing your documentation site effectively. The framework follows a **file-based routing** system where your directory structure directly maps to your site's URL structure.

## Default Docusaurus Project Structure

When you create a new Docusaurus project, you'll see the following directory structure:

<FileCollapsibleCodeBlock 
  content={DefaultStructure} 
  filename="default-structure.txt" 
  collapsed={false}
/>

## Key Directory Concepts

### File-Based Routing

Docusaurus automatically creates routes based on your file structure:

- `docs/intro.md` → `/docs/intro`
- `src/pages/about.js` → `/about`
- `blog/2024-01-01-hello.md` → `/blog/hello`

### Directory Hierarchy

The structure follows these principles:

1. **Top-level directories** serve specific purposes (docs, blog, src, static)
2. **Nested directories** create route hierarchies
3. **Special files** control behavior (_category_.json, index files)
4. **Asset organization** keeps related files together

## Benefits of This Structure

- **Intuitive organization**: Files are where you expect them to be
- **Automatic routing**: No need to manually configure routes
- **Easy maintenance**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Scalable**: Structure grows naturally with content

Now that you understand the basic structure, let's explore the special directories and their specific purposes in the next section.
