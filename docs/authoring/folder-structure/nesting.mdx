# Nesting Depth

You can nest folders multiple levels deep:

```
docs/
└── platform/
    └── features/
        └── authentication/
            ├── index.mdx
            ├── oauth.mdx
            └── jwt.mdx
```

URL: `/docs/platform/features/authentication/oauth`

## Recommendations

**Keep nesting to 2-3 levels maximum** for better navigation.

Deep nesting can cause:
- Long, unwieldy URLs
- Difficult sidebar navigation
- Confusion about content location
- Mobile usability issues

## When to Use Deep Nesting

Deep nesting makes sense when:
- Content has a natural hierarchical structure
- Users expect to drill down through categories
- The top-level categories are too broad otherwise

## Alternatives to Deep Nesting

Instead of deep nesting, consider:
- **Flat structure with tags** - Use frontmatter tags for categorization
- **Separate doc sections** - Create independent plugin routes
- **Landing pages with links** - Use index pages to link related content
