# Ordering Pages

There are two main ways to control the order of pages in the sidebar.

## Using sidebar_position

The most reliable way to order pages:

```markdown
---
title: Introduction
sidebar_position: 1
---
```

```markdown
---
title: Installation
sidebar_position: 2
---
```

```markdown
---
title: Configuration
sidebar_position: 3
---
```

## Using Filename Prefixes

Alternative approach using numeric prefixes:

```
getting-started/
├── 01-introduction.mdx
├── 02-installation.mdx
├── 03-configuration.mdx
└── 04-first-steps.mdx
```

Note: `sidebar_position` always takes precedence over filename ordering.

## Mixed Ordering

When some pages have `sidebar_position` and others don't:

1. Pages with `sidebar_position` appear first, in numeric order
2. Pages without `sidebar_position` appear after, in alphabetical order

## Best Practice

Use `sidebar_position` in frontmatter for explicit control. This approach:

- Is more explicit and readable
- Doesn't require filename changes when reordering
- Works consistently across different sorting implementations
