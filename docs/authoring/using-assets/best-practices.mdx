# Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to keep your assets organized and maintainable.

## 1. Name Files Descriptively

```
# Good
assets/
├── button-primary-example.tsx
├── button-disabled-state.tsx
└── form-validation-schema.ts

# Avoid
assets/
├── code1.tsx
├── code2.tsx
└── example.ts
```

## 2. Keep Assets Close to Content

Place assets in the same section as the content that uses them:

```
components/
├── buttons.mdx        # References button assets
└── assets/
    └── button-*.tsx   # Button-related assets
```

## 3. Use Consistent Naming

Follow a pattern: `[component]-[variant]-[purpose].[ext]`

```
button-primary-example.tsx
button-secondary-disabled.tsx
card-image-with-actions.tsx
```

## 4. Document Complex Examples

Add comments in your asset files:

```tsx
// assets/form-example.tsx

/**
 * Example: Form with validation
 *
 * This example demonstrates:
 * - Field validation
 * - Error messages
 * - Submit handling
 */
export function FormExample() {
  // ...
}
```

## 5. Version Control Friendly

Keep assets small and focused. If an example file is getting too long, split it into multiple files.

```
# Instead of one large file
assets/
└── complete-example.tsx  # 500 lines

# Split into focused pieces
assets/
├── example-component.tsx
├── example-styles.css
├── example-hooks.ts
└── example-utils.ts
```

## 6. Clean Up Unused Assets

When removing or refactoring documentation:
- Delete assets that are no longer referenced
- Check for orphaned files periodically
- Use your IDE's "find references" feature
