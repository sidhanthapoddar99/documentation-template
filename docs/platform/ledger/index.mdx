# Neura Ledger

## Introduction

Neura Ledger is the distributed transaction and state management system that ensures consistency and immutability across the NeuraLabs platform.

## Features

### Transaction Management
- ACID compliance
- Multi-signature support
- Batch processing
- Real-time settlement

### State Management
- Merkle tree structure
- State snapshots
- Efficient querying
- Historical data access

### Consensus
- Byzantine fault tolerance
- Fast finality
- Low latency
- High throughput

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Transaction Pool**
   - Mempool management
   - Transaction validation
   - Fee estimation
   - Priority queuing

2. **Block Producer**
   - Block assembly
   - Transaction ordering
   - Consensus participation
   - Block propagation

3. **State Database**
   - Key-value storage
   - Merkle proofs
   - State transitions
   - Pruning strategies

## API Reference

### Submit Transaction
```javascript
const tx = await ledger.submitTransaction({
    from: senderAddress,
    to: recipientAddress,
    amount: 100,
    data: metadata
});
```

### Query State
```javascript
const state = await ledger.getState({
    address: contractAddress,
    key: 'balance'
});
```

## Performance Metrics

- TPS: 100,000+
- Finality: < 1 second
- Storage: Optimized compression
- Network: Efficient propagation
