# Neura Synthesis

## Overview

Neura Synthesis is the AI model creation, training, and deployment system within NeuraLabs, enabling rapid development of intelligent agents.

## Core Capabilities

### Model Development
- Pre-trained model library
- Custom architecture design
- Transfer learning support
- Model versioning

### Training Pipeline
- Distributed training
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Real-time monitoring
- Automated checkpointing

### Deployment
- One-click deployment
- A/B testing
- Gradual rollout
- Rollback capabilities

## Workflow

### 1. Model Creation
```python
from neura.synthesis import ModelBuilder

model = ModelBuilder()
    .add_layer('transformer', units=512)
    .add_layer('attention', heads=8)
    .add_layer('dense', units=256)
    .compile()
```

### 2. Training
```python
trainer = model.train(
    dataset=training_data,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32,
    distributed=True
)
```

### 3. Deployment
```python
deployment = model.deploy(
    name='agent-v1',
    replicas=3,
    auto_scale=True
)
```
