# NeuraLock

## Overview

NeuraLock is the security backbone of the NeuraLabs platform, providing robust authentication, authorization, and encryption services.

## Features

### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication
- Biometric support
- Hardware key integration
- Session management

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained permissions
- Dynamic policy enforcement
- Audit logging

### Encryption
- AES-256 encryption at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Homomorphic encryption for sensitive computations
- Key rotation and management

## Implementation

### API Authentication
```javascript
const auth = await NeuraLock.authenticate({
  credentials: userCredentials,
  mfaToken: mfaCode
});
```

### Access Control
```javascript
const hasAccess = await NeuraLock.authorize({
  userId: auth.userId,
  resource: 'agent.create',
  action: 'write'
});
```

## Security Best Practices

1. Enable MFA for all accounts
2. Regular security audits
3. Monitor access logs
4. Implement least privilege principle
