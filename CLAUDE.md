Astro-based documentation framework with modular layouts, YAML configuration, and live editing via Yjs CRDT.

## Skills + tooling

This project ships a Claude Code plugin (`documentation-guide`) — source at `plugins/documentation-guide/`. See the README for install instructions.

**Skills (2).** `documentation-guide` triages every docs/blog/config/writing task to one of five reference targets (`writing.md`, `docs-layout.md`, `blog-layout.md`, `settings-layout.md`, `images.md`) — trigger eagerly for anything under `default-docs/` *outside the tracker*. `doc-issues` is the self-contained issue-tracker skill — the whole anatomy (`brainstorm/` · `notes/` · `subtasks/` · `agent-log/` activity folders · `agent-memory/` · flat `comments/` · `glossary.md`), the creation threshold rules + issue dump, the 7-status / 4-category lifecycle (statuses fixed in framework code, shared by issues + subtasks under one `status` field) + AI rules, and its own tracker-flavoured writing reference; it also fires on the execution verbs (audit / refactor / loop / discuss) against a tracked issue, keeps always-on agent-memory, and treats discussion as explicit-save-only (offer when dense, never auto-save). It absorbed the former `doc-agent` skill. For anything under `default-docs/data/todo/`, load `doc-issues`.

The plugin's skills carry the full operating manual, including the `docs-guide` CLI — defer to them for command usage rather than duplicating the toolkit here. They trigger automatically on docs/issue/blog/config work.

**Skills are lean and history-free.** A skill (and any published doc) describes the *current* system only — never past formats, removed features, renamed fields, or "content written before X may…" notes. History lives in git and the issue tracker; format transitions live in `migration/` scripts (surfaced through the skill's `doc-migration.md` protocol, which is the one legitimate place that talks about legacy formats). When editing a skill and you find a historical aside, delete it rather than preserving it — same rule as removed designs in the tracker: negative/removed things are deleted, not narrated.

**Bundled issue guide.** `astro-doc-code/src/layouts/issues/default/guide.ts` is a TypeScript module holding a static *issue-anatomy* guide (a thin legend of what each section is), rendered on every issue's **Guide** panel. It's the framework-bundled, plugin-independent twin of the `doc-issues` skill's manual — present at every build/deploy even when the plugin isn't installed. Keep the two in sync: the skill carries the full manual, `guide.ts` carries the map.

**Tracker mental model.** This tracker is comprehensive memory of thought-work for AI-augmented development. Each issue is a folder capturing one coherent unit of *thinking + execution* — deliberate (`brainstorm/`) → write down (`notes/`) → plan (`subtasks/`) → execute (`agent-log/`), with flat `comments/` as the evolution log and `agent-memory/` as AI working state. Ordering is `priority desc, updated desc`; `updated` is derived from git history (most recent commit touching anything under the folder). `created` comes from the folder slug. Best-practices: exactly one `component` per issue — tag by center of gravity even for cross-cutting work (hint-warned by validator when >1); AI-handoff-bound issues should declare ≥1 subtask; a thought earns a full issue only if you can name its component and first subtask in one breath (otherwise: subtask, brainstorm entry, or dump — see the `doc-issues` skill). **Don't add scheduling, release-bucket, or single-type fields without an explicit policy reversal** — they rot under continuous AI-driven shipping. Full framing: `default-docs/data/user-guide/19_issues/01_overview.md` and `02_design-philosophy.md`.

**2 slash commands** for project-level scaffolding:

| Command | Use |
|---|---|
| `/docs-init` | Bootstrap a new documentation-template project from zero — interactive: scope (whole repo vs subfolder) → site name → first section → writes `config/`, `data/`, starter page, patches `CLAUDE.md`. Prints framework-clone command at the end. |
| `/docs-add-section [name]` | Scaffold a new top-level section under `data/` — auto-computes next `NN_` prefix, creates `settings.json` + starter page, optionally registers in `site.yaml`. |

## Repository Layout

The framework lives entirely in `astro-doc-code/`. The repo root holds user content, config, and the `start` wrapper. `paths.ts` distinguishes `frameworkRoot` (`astro-doc-code/`, where `src/` lives) from `projectRoot` (the repo root, where `default-docs/` and `.env` live). `astro.config.mjs` reads `.env` from `repoRoot`, not `process.cwd()` — so it works regardless of which directory you launch from.

**user-guide vs dev-docs — the audience split.** `user-guide/` teaches *how to use* the framework to author documentation: what a feature does for the writer, the syntax/config to use it, and live examples (e.g. how to embed an excalidraw scene in a page). `dev-docs/` documents *how the framework implements* it from an internal code perspective: which layers the feature touches, the pipeline stages, extension points, and design rationale (e.g. how the embed postprocessor + asset route + client renderer fit together). When shipping a feature, docs usually land on **both** sides — usage in user-guide, mechanism in dev-docs. A page that explains internals inside user-guide, or usage instructions inside dev-docs, is misfiled.

## Key Architecture Concepts

**Path resolution**: `site.yaml` `paths:` section defines `@key` aliases (`@data`, `@assets`, `@themes`). User aliases are resolved to absolute paths at config load time. System aliases (`@docs`, `@blog`, `@issues`, `@custom`, `@navbar`, `@footer`) remain as layout references resolved at render time. **`@root`** is reserved and resolves to **the framework folder** (parent of `astro-doc-code/`, where `.env` and `default-docs/` live) — NOT the consumer's outer project. Usable both as a direct reference (`@root/default-docs/themes/foo.css`) and inside `paths:` values to compose user aliases against the framework folder (e.g. `default-docs: "@root/default-docs/data"`). Path-traversal escapes are rejected; only `@root` is allowed inside `paths:` values (other aliases are layout/theme concepts and user-to-user references are rejected to avoid ordering ambiguity).

**Two operating modes**: *Consumer mode* — framework folder is a subfolder of the user's project (`<user-project>/documentation-template/`), `.env` lives inside it with `CONFIG_DIR=../config` reaching up to the user's content. *Dogfood / framework-dev mode* — framework repo IS the project (this repo), `CONFIG_DIR=./default-docs/config` points at the bundled config. Same code path either way; only `CONFIG_DIR` and the active content location differ. The consumer never edits `default-docs/` — that's the framework's own bundle (its docs, testbed, and source of defaults).

**Version contract**: content declares the engine version it targets in `site.yaml → engine_version: "N.N.N"` (missing → `0.0.0`); the engine carries `ENGINE_VERSION` + `MIN_CONTENT_VERSION` in `src/loaders/engine-version.ts`, and `loadSiteConfig()` hard-stops on content outside `[floor, engine]` — it never starts. Migrations live at repo-root `migration/` (`<to-version>_<statement>.py`, version order = execution order) and cover **every class of format change — frontmatter/field renames, settings-schema reshapes, AND content-syntax changes** (retired/replaced markup in page bodies, e.g. `0.1.2_legacy-custom-tags.py`); syntax migrations are the easiest to forget because old markup doesn't error, it silently misrenders — a release that retires a syntax owes its script. Two non-negotiables: **never bump `engine_version` past the gate** — run the full migration chain first (every script in the range, detect → dry-run → migrate → re-detect; a zero-hit detect is a passed check, not a skipped script) — and **the floor moves only on breaking changes** (`MIN_CONTENT_VERSION` means "oldest content that still works unmigrated", not "newest migration available"). The full discipline — gate mechanics, the breaking vs good-to-have floor decision, the standardized script structure (detect/locate/migrate/verify subcommands over split test-vs-fix function families), authoring + shipping checklist — is documented in **dev-docs `30_versioning/`** (consumer view: user-guide `10_configuration/07_versioning.md`); the skill's `doc-migration.md` carries the AI operating protocol. Read those rather than re-deriving here.

**Theme resolution**: `site.yaml` `theme: "name"` specifies the active theme by name. `theme_paths: ["@themes"]` lists directories to scan for user themes. `resolveThemeName()` scans those directories during `loadSiteConfig()` and resolves to an absolute path. Theme inheritance (`extends` in `theme.yaml`) uses `@theme/` aliases resolved at theme load time.

**Theme variable contract**: `src/styles/theme.yaml` declares `required_variables` — a contract every theme (built-in and user) must satisfy. Layouts MUST consume only these variables; inventing names with inline fallbacks (e.g. `var(--color-accent, #7aa2f7)`) is how bugs creep in — the var never resolves, the fallback freezes the value, dark/light mode stops working. See the "Theming" section below.

**Layout resolution**: `[...slug].astro` matches `page.type` (`docs` | `blog` | `issues` | `custom`) to a layout via `import.meta.glob()`. Layout aliases like `@docs/default` map to `src/layouts/docs/default/Layout.astro`. Some content types (blog, issues) have an index+detail split and register both `IndexLayout.astro` and `PostLayout.astro` / `DetailLayout.astro`.

**Content loading**: `data.ts` (docs, blog) and `issues.ts` (issues) require absolute paths (resolved at config load time) and use mtime-based caching with dependency tracking.

## Layouts

A **layout** is a folder under `src/layouts/<type>/<style>/` that renders pages of a given content type. Types are fixed by the routing layer; styles are pluggable (each adds a variant like `default`, `compact`, `minimal`). User themes can ship layouts in `default-docs/layouts/<type>/<style>/` which override built-in styles via the `@ext-layouts` alias.

### Layout types

| Type | Routing | Entry file(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs` | `/<base>/<slug>` | `Layout.astro` | Single template for list + detail (sidebar-driven) |
| `blog` | `/<base>` + `/<base>/<slug>` | `IndexLayout.astro`, `PostLayout.astro` | Flat files named `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` |
| `issues` | `/<base>` + `/<base>/<id>` | `IndexLayout.astro`, `DetailLayout.astro` | Folder-per-item (`YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`), `settings.json`-driven metadata, vocabulary in root `settings.json`, multi-file support (issue.md + comments/ + supporting *.md) |
| `custom` | `/<base>` | `Layout.astro` | Freeform page (home, about, countdown, …) |

### Conventions for a new layout

1. **Folder**: `src/layouts/<type>/<style>/` (peer of existing styles). Do NOT put new first-class content types under `custom/`.
2. **Required file(s)**: one `Layout.astro` for docs/custom; `IndexLayout.astro` + `PostLayout.astro` (blog) or `DetailLayout.astro` (issues).
3. **Refactor at scale**: keep any single `.astro` or `.ts` file under ~400 lines. Split into `parts/` subcomponents (see `issues/default/parts/` for the pattern — `FilterBar`, `IssuesTable`, `Pagination`, `client.ts`, etc.).
4. **Client logic**: put interactive JS in `parts/client.ts` and load it via `<script>import { init } from './parts/client'; init();</script>`. Pass server data to the client through a `<script type="application/json" id="…-config">` tag, NOT `define:vars` (which breaks when scripts bundle/import local modules).
5. **CSS scoping gotcha**: elements created at runtime via `innerHTML` / `createElement` don't receive Astro's `data-astro-cid-*` attribute, so scoped selectors skip them. For styles that target dynamic nodes, wrap them in `:global(.classname) { … }`.
6. **Register routing**: add globs + a branch in `src/pages/[...slug].astro` (for new types) and add the alias (`@<type>`) in `src/loaders/alias.ts`.

### UX standards

Every layout surface follows the framework's UX standards — truncation-only tooltips (`data-tip`, with `data-tip-always` for icons/symbols), file-type glyphs that mark only the non-markdown exception, status color exclusively through the theme status variables, hierarchy from weight/position rather than size, passive glanceable status marks, and keeping `data-tip`/`aria-label` in step when client code swaps state. The rules with rationale and file map live in **dev-docs `05_architecture/05_layout-internals/08_ux-standards.md`** — read it before adding chrome to any layout; don't re-derive or re-document the rules here.

## Theming

**All CSS in layouts MUST consume declared theme variables — no invented names, no hardcoded fallbacks.** The full contract lives in `src/styles/theme.yaml → required_variables`. The cheat sheet:

| Purpose | Use |
|---|---|
| Text colors | `--color-text-primary` / `--color-text-secondary` / `--color-text-muted` |
| Backgrounds | `--color-bg-primary` (page) / `--color-bg-secondary` (cards) / `--color-bg-tertiary` (table headers, subtle tints) |
| Borders | `--color-border-default` / `--color-border-light` |
| Brand/accent | `--color-brand-primary` / `--color-brand-secondary` |
| Status | `--color-success` / `--color-warning` / `--color-error` / `--color-info` |
| Font families | `--font-family-base` / `--font-family-mono` |
| Font sizes (required) | `--font-size-sm` (14px) / `--font-size-base` (16) / `--font-size-lg` (18) / `--font-size-xl` (20) / `--font-size-2xl` (24) |
| Font sizes (default-theme-only) | `--font-size-xs` (12px) — use with `--font-size-sm` fallback: `var(--font-size-xs, var(--font-size-sm))` |
| Spacing | `--spacing-xs/sm/md/lg/xl/2xl` |
| Radius | `--border-radius-sm/md/lg/xl` (plus `--border-radius-full` for pills) |
| Shadows | `--shadow-sm/md/lg/xl` |
| Transitions | `--transition-fast` (150ms) / `--transition-normal` (250ms) |

**Do not** reach for hex codes, arbitrary `rem` font sizes, or invented variable names. If something feels missing from the contract, propose adding it to `theme.yaml` before inventing a private name.

**Coupling — `theme.yaml` ↔ artifact-authoring skill.** The `documentation-guide` plugin's `artifact-authoring` skill carries an **inline copy** of the `required_variables` vocabulary in its text (SKILL.md §1 "inline variable contract"), so `site`-mode artifacts have the token names even if the plugin is ever distributed standalone with no theme CSS on disk. That inline list is coupled to this contract: **any change to `theme.yaml → required_variables` (add / rename / remove) must update the skill's inline variable section in the same change — both the repo source (`plugins/documentation-guide/skills/artifact-authoring/SKILL.md`) and the installed cache** (mirror byte-identically). The live *values* are served by `docs-guide theme tokens --json`; only the *names* are duplicated inline.

### Where themes live

- **Built-in default theme**: `src/styles/` — `theme.yaml` (contract), `color.css`, `font.css`, `element.css`, `markdown.css`, etc.
- **User themes**: `default-docs/themes/<name>/` — each has its own `theme.yaml` (usually `extends: "@theme/default"`) and any CSS overrides.
- **Active theme selector**: `site.yaml → theme: "<name>"`; `theme_paths: ["@themes"]` controls which dirs to scan.

### Typography regulations — two-tier token model

The typography system follows the **primitive / semantic token pattern**. Layouts MUST consume the semantic tokens — never the primitive `--font-size-*` scale directly. The primitives are the palette; the semantic tokens carry intent.

**Layer 1 — primitive scale** (in `src/styles/font.css`, theme-internal):
`--font-size-xs / sm / base / lg / xl / 2xl / 3xl / 4xl / 5xl`. Themes can override these. **Layouts should not reference them.**

**Layer 2 — semantic UI tokens** (for chrome — buttons, cards, tables, badges, forms, nav, footer):

| Tier | Token | Default value | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Micro | `--ui-text-micro` | `--font-size-xs` (12px) | Badges, counts, ids, timestamps, field labels |
| Body | `--ui-text-body` | `--font-size-sm` (14px) | Default body, table rows, inputs, descriptions, **card titles** |
| Title | `--ui-text-title` | `--font-size-2xl` (24px) | Page titles, major landmarks |

Three tiers is the whole chrome palette. For card titles, primary buttons, and anything that needs to feel emphasised, **use `--ui-text-body` + `font-weight: 600` + `color: var(--color-text-primary)`** — hierarchy from weight/color, not size. Modern design systems (Polaris, GitHub Primer for chrome, Linear, Notion) all use this pattern. Adding a fourth chrome size tier is almost always a sign you're encoding importance with size when weight/color/position would do better.

**Layer 2 — semantic content tokens** (for rendered markdown / prose — `markdown.css` + any layout embedding prose):

| Token | Default value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--content-body` | `--font-size-base` | Body paragraphs |
| `--content-h1` | `--font-size-4xl` | h1 |
| `--content-h2` | `--font-size-2xl` | h2 |
| `--content-h3` | `--font-size-xl` | h3 |
| `--content-h4` | `--font-size-lg` | h4 |
| `--content-h5` | `--font-size-base` | h5 |
| `--content-h6` | `--font-size-sm` | h6 |
| `--content-code` | `0.9em` | Inline `<code>` — em-relative, scales with parent |

**Layer 2 — display tokens** (marketing / landing / countdown surfaces only):

`--display-sm` (`3xl`) / `--display-md` (`4xl`) / `--display-lg` (`5xl`). Only used in `src/layouts/custom/home`, countdown, hero sections. Do NOT use in docs / blog / issues / app chrome. Fluid `clamp()` is also acceptable here for poster-style text.

**Why the split?** Even when values coincide (`--ui-text-title` and `--content-h2` both resolve to 24px today), the *names* carry intent. A future redesign that bumps UI chrome to a denser scale won't accidentally shrink markdown headings. Reviewers don't have to guess whether `--font-size-lg` in a layout means "large-ish UI" or "h4 content".

**Rules for any layout:**

- Consume semantic tokens (`--ui-text-*`, `--content-*`, `--display-*`) — never primitive `--font-size-*` and never raw rem/px.
- If a size isn't on any scale, fold it into the nearest tier rather than inventing a new value.
- Before reaching for a 5th UI chrome size, ask whether color/weight/position would encode the hierarchy better.
- `em` units are OK when the intent is *relative to surrounding text* (e.g. `<code>` inside a heading). That's a conscious relative choice, not a scale violation.
- Custom / marketing layouts (`src/layouts/custom/**`) MAY reach for `--display-*` or fluid `clamp()`. Those are the only places display tiers belong.

## Build Commands

Use the `./start` wrapper at the repo root.

```bash
./start            # Preflight: pick bun (else npm) → install if needed → build sanity check → dev
./start dev        # Skip preflight, run dev only
./start build      # Skip preflight, run build only
./start preview    # Skip preflight, run preview only
./start <script>   # Forward any package.json script
```

Preflight (no-arg form) does: update check (fetches upstream and prompts `Y/n` to fast-forward pull when behind — bails silently if no upstream, dirty tree, diverged, offline, or non-interactive), runner detection (bun preferred, npm fallback), `bun install` if `node_modules` is missing, full production build (aborts on failure), then dev. The update check runs for every form (`./start`, `./start dev`, `./start clean dev`); set `START_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to bypass (CI, scripted use). Useful for a clean clone or after dependency changes; for the everyday tight loop use `./start dev` to skip the build step.

**Windows (native cmd / PowerShell):** use `.\start.cmd` with the same arguments (`.\start.cmd dev`, `.\start.cmd clean build`, …). It launches `start.ps1`, a full port of the bash script (same preflight, update check, clean, runner fallback). Note the leading `.\` — bare `start` is a cmd built-in / PowerShell alias. Git Bash and WSL use `./start` as on Linux.

If you're inside `astro-doc-code/`, `bun run dev` / `bun run build` / `bun run preview` work directly.

## Key Rules

1. **`NN_` prefix required** for all doc files/folders — numeric, **2–5 digits** (2 is the common case), sorted by value (widths coexist; gap-space to leave insert room)
2. **`settings.json` required** in every doc folder
3. **`title` frontmatter required** in every doc file
4. **`theme` field required** in `site.yaml` (throws if missing)
5. **Assets folder** excluded from sidebar (no prefix needed)
6. **No hardcoded colors/fonts/spacing** in layouts — consume the declared theme contract (see "Theming" above)
7. **Split large layout files** at ~400 lines into `parts/` subcomponents; client JS in a single `client.ts`
8. **Issues** use folder-per-item (`YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`) with `settings.json` for metadata; vocabulary in the tracker's root `settings.json`
9. **`engine_version` in `site.yaml`** — content outside the engine's supported range is a hard startup error (see "Version contract" above); after any migration, bump it to the engine's version
