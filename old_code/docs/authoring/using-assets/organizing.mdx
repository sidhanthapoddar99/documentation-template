# Organizing Assets

For sections with many assets, use sub-folders and consistent naming conventions.

## Sub-Folders by Topic

Create sub-folders to organize assets by topic:

```
components/
├── index.mdx
├── buttons.mdx
├── cards.mdx
└── assets/
    ├── buttons/
    │   ├── primary.tsx
    │   ├── secondary.tsx
    │   └── icon-button.tsx
    ├── cards/
    │   ├── basic-card.tsx
    │   └── image-card.tsx
    └── shared/
        └── types.ts
```

Import with the full path:

```mdx
import PrimaryButton from '!!raw-loader!./assets/buttons/primary.tsx';
import SharedTypes from '!!raw-loader!./assets/shared/types.ts';
```

## Page-Specific Assets

For assets used by a single page, create a folder matching the page name:

```
configuration/
├── themes.mdx
├── layouts.mdx
└── assets/
    ├── themes/              # Assets for themes.mdx
    │   ├── dark-theme.css
    │   └── light-theme.css
    └── layouts/             # Assets for layouts.mdx
        ├── sidebar-layout.tsx
        └── full-width-layout.tsx
```

This pattern:
- Makes it clear which assets belong to which page
- Simplifies cleanup when pages are removed
- Keeps related files together

## Shared Assets

For assets used across multiple pages, use a `shared/` or `common/` folder:

```
docs/
├── getting-started/
│   ├── index.mdx
│   └── assets/
│       └── shared/
│           ├── types.ts
│           └── utils.ts
```

## When to Split Assets

Consider splitting assets when:
- A single `assets/` folder has more than 10-15 files
- Files are clearly related to specific pages
- You have shared utilities used across multiple pages
