# Using Assets

Assets are supporting files like code snippets, images, configuration examples, and diagrams that you reference in your documentation. This guide explains how to organize and use them effectively.

## Overview

This section covers:

- [Importing Code](./importing-code) - Using raw-loader for code snippets
- [File Types](./file-types) - Supported file extensions
- [Importing Images](./importing-images) - Adding images and media
- [Organizing Assets](./organizing) - Folder structure for large sections
- [Best Practices](./best-practices) - Naming and organization tips
- [Common Patterns](./patterns) - Examples for different documentation types
- [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) - Fixing common issues

## The Assets Folder

Every documentation section can have an `assets` folder that is **automatically excluded** from the sidebar and routing.

```
components/
├── index.mdx
├── buttons.mdx
├── cards.mdx
└── assets/              # ← Not shown in sidebar
    ├── button-example.tsx
    ├── card-example.tsx
    └── screenshot.png
```

## Why Use Assets?

1. **Keep code separate** - Easier to maintain and syntax-highlight
2. **Avoid MDX escaping issues** - Raw files don't need escaping
3. **Reuse across pages** - Import the same asset in multiple files
4. **Clean organization** - Supporting files don't clutter the sidebar
