# Special Folders

Certain folder names have special behavior in the documentation framework.

## Assets Folder

Any folder named `assets` is **completely excluded** from the sidebar and routing:

```
configuration/
├── index.mdx
├── themes.mdx
└── assets/           # ← Excluded from sidebar
    ├── theme-example.css
    ├── config-sample.json
    └── screenshot.png
```

Use assets folders for:
- Code snippets to import into MDX
- Images and diagrams
- Configuration examples
- Any supporting files

See [Using Assets](/docs/authoring/using-assets) for details on importing these files.

## Why Assets Are Excluded

The `assets` folder exclusion allows you to:

1. **Keep supporting files organized** alongside the content that uses them
2. **Avoid sidebar clutter** from non-documentation files
3. **Reference files easily** with relative imports
4. **Maintain clean URLs** without asset paths showing up as routes
