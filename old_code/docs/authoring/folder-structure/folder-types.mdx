# Folder Types

There are two main types of folder structures in documentation: folders with an index file (clickable) and folders without (non-clickable).

## Folder with Index (Clickable Section)

When a folder contains an `index.md` or `index.mdx` file, it becomes a **clickable section** in the sidebar.

```
components/
├── index.mdx          # ← This makes "Components" clickable
├── buttons.mdx
├── cards.mdx
└── forms.mdx
```

**Sidebar appears as:**
```
▼ Components          ← Clickable, links to index.mdx
    Buttons
    Cards
    Forms
```

The index file typically contains:
- An overview of the section
- Links to child pages
- Summary of what's covered

# Components

This section covers all available UI components.

## Available Components

- [Buttons](/docs/components/buttons) - Button variants and usage
- [Cards](/docs/components/cards) - Card layouts
- [Forms](/docs/components/forms) - Form elements
```

## Folder without Index (Non-Clickable Group)

When a folder has **no index file**, it becomes a non-clickable category label.

```
api-reference/
├── authentication.mdx
├── endpoints.mdx
└── errors.mdx
```

**Sidebar appears as:**
```
▾ Api Reference       ← Not clickable, just a label
    Authentication
    Endpoints
    Errors
```

Use this pattern when:
- The section doesn't need an overview page
- You just want to group related pages visually
- The first child page serves as the introduction

## Non-Clickable Folder with Metadata (index.json)

If you want a non-clickable folder but still need to control its metadata (like sidebar position or label), use an `index.json` file instead of `index.mdx`.

```
api-reference/
├── index.json         # ← Metadata only, folder stays non-clickable
├── authentication.mdx
├── endpoints.mdx
└── errors.mdx
```

**index.json contents:**
```json
{
  "label": "API Reference",
  "position": 3,
  "className": "sidebar-header"
}
```

**Sidebar appears as:**
```
▾ API Reference       ← Not clickable, but positioned at 3
    Authentication
    Endpoints
    Errors
```

### Available index.json Options

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `label` | string | Custom sidebar label for the folder |
| `position` | number | Sidebar position (like `sidebar_position`) |
| `className` | string | CSS class to apply to the sidebar item |
| `collapsible` | boolean | Whether the folder can be collapsed |
| `collapsed` | boolean | Whether to start collapsed |

### When to Use index.json

Use `index.json` when:
- You need to control folder position without a landing page
- You want a custom label different from the folder name
- You need to apply CSS classes (like `sidebar-header`)
- You want to control collapsibility settings

```json
{
  "label": "Components",
  "position": 1,
  "className": "sidebar-header",
  "collapsible": false
}
```

This creates a non-clickable, non-collapsible header that acts as a section divider in the sidebar
