## Quick Reference

| Pattern | Clickable? | Use When |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Folder with `index.mdx` | Yes | Section needs an overview page |
| Folder without index | No | Just grouping related pages |
| `assets/` folder | N/A | Storing supporting files |
| Top-level `.mdx` file | Yes | Standalone page |
