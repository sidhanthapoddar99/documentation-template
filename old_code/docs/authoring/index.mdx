# Writing Documentation

This guide covers everything you need to know about creating documentation in this framework. You'll learn about file formats, folder structure, frontmatter metadata, and how to organize your content effectively.

## Quick Start

To create a new documentation page:

1. Create a `.md` or `.mdx` file in the `docs/` folder
2. Add frontmatter at the top with at least a `title`
3. Write your content in Markdown or MDX

```markdown
---
title: My New Page
description: A brief description for SEO
sidebar_position: 1
---

# My New Page

Your content here...
```

## Supported File Formats

| Format | Extension | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Markdown | `.md` | Standard Markdown syntax |
| MDX | `.mdx` | Markdown with JSX components |

Both formats support the same frontmatter options. Use `.mdx` when you need to embed React/Astro components in your content.

## Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── getting-started/
│   ├── index.mdx          # Section landing page (clickable)
│   ├── installation.mdx   # Child page
│   └── quick-start.mdx    # Child page
├── configuration/
│   ├── index.mdx          # Section landing page
│   ├── themes.mdx
│   └── assets/            # Assets folder (not rendered)
│       └── example.ts
├── api/                   # Folder without index (not clickable)
│   ├── endpoints.mdx      # Shows as grouped items
│   └── authentication.mdx
└── standalone-page.mdx    # Top-level page
```

## Key Concepts

### Folders with Index

A folder containing an `index.md` or `index.mdx` file becomes a **clickable section**:
- The index file serves as the section's landing page
- Child files appear nested under it in the sidebar
- Clicking the section name navigates to the index page

### Folders without Index

A folder without an index file becomes a **non-clickable group**:
- Acts as a visual divider/category in the sidebar
- Child files are grouped under the folder name
- The folder name itself is not a link

### Assets Folder

Any folder named `assets` is **excluded from rendering**:
- Use it to store code snippets, images, or other files
- Reference these files in your MDX using imports
- Keeps your content organized without cluttering the sidebar

## Page Ordering

Pages are ordered by:

1. **`sidebar_position`** (highest priority) - Explicit numeric position
2. **Filename** (fallback) - Alphabetical order

```markdown
---
title: First Page
sidebar_position: 1    # Appears first
---
```

```markdown
---
title: Second Page
sidebar_position: 2    # Appears second
---
```

Pages without `sidebar_position` are sorted alphabetically after positioned pages.
