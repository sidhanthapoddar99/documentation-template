# Validation & Best Practices

## Frontmatter Validation

The framework validates frontmatter at build time. Invalid values will cause build errors:

```
Error: Invalid frontmatter in docs/my-page.mdx
  - "sidebar_position" expected number, received string
```

### Common Validation Errors

- Missing required `title` field
- Wrong type (string instead of number, etc.)
- Invalid date format
- Unrecognized field names (typos)

### Fixing Validation Errors

```yaml
# Wrong - sidebar_position should be a number
sidebar_position: "1"

# Correct
sidebar_position: 1
```

```yaml
# Wrong - invalid date format
published_at: January 15, 2024

# Correct
published_at: 2024-01-15
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Always Include `title`

It's the only required field and ensures your page has proper metadata.

### 2. Add `description`

Improves SEO and appears in search results. Keep it between 150-160 characters.

### 3. Use `sidebar_position`

Provides predictable ordering instead of relying on alphabetical sorting.

### 4. Keep `sidebar_label` Short

Sidebar space is limited. Use short, scannable labels.

### 5. Use `draft: true` for WIP

Mark work-in-progress content as drafts to prevent accidental publishing.

### 6. Consistent Date Format

Always use `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates to avoid ambiguity.

### 7. Don't Over-Specify

You don't need to include every field. Use only what's necessary:

```yaml
# Unnecessary - these are all defaults
hide_title: false
hide_toc: false
full_width: false
draft: false

# Better - only specify what you need
---
title: My Page
description: A useful description
sidebar_position: 1

```
