# Publishing Control

These fields control the publication state and timing of your documentation.

## draft

Mark a page as a draft to exclude it from production builds.

```yaml
draft: true
```

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Required:** No
- **Default:** `false`
- Draft pages are visible in development but excluded from production

### When to Use Drafts

Use `draft: true` when:
- Content is work-in-progress
- You want to preview before publishing
- Collaborating on content that isn't ready

```yaml
---
title: New Feature Documentation
draft: true  # Remove when ready to publish
---
```

## published_at

Original publication date.

```yaml
published_at: 2024-01-15
```

- **Type:** `date`
- **Required:** No
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` or full ISO date

### Date Formats

```yaml
# Simple date
published_at: 2024-01-15

# Full ISO date with time
published_at: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
```

## updated_at

Last update date.

```yaml
updated_at: 2024-06-20
```

- **Type:** `date`
- **Required:** No
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` or full ISO date
- Useful for showing "Last updated" on pages

### Tracking Updates

Some documentation sites display "Last updated" to help readers know if content is current:

```yaml
---
title: API Reference
published_at: 2024-01-15
updated_at: 2024-06-20
---
```

This tells readers the content was originally published in January but has been updated as recently as June.
