# Required Fields

## title

The page title displayed in the sidebar, browser tab, and as the main heading.

```yaml
title: Getting Started
```

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** Yes
- Used for: Sidebar label, `<title>` tag, `<h1>` if not overridden

### Usage Notes

The `title` is the only truly required field. Every documentation page must have a title.

```yaml
---
title: Quick Start
---
```

### Title vs Heading

The `title` in frontmatter sets:
- The sidebar label
- The browser tab title
- The default `<h1>` if you don't add one in content

You can override the page heading by adding your own `# Heading` in the content:

```markdown
---
title: Quick Start Guide
---

# Getting Started Quickly

This heading overrides the title for display purposes.
```

In this case, the sidebar shows "Quick Start Guide" but the page displays "Getting Started Quickly" as the main heading.
