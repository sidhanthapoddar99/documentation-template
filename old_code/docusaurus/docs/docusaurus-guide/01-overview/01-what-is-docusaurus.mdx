# What is Docusaurus?

Docusaurus is a **static site generator** built on React that specializes in documentation websites. It's designed to make it easy to create, maintain, and deploy documentation sites with minimal configuration while providing powerful customization options.

**Static Site Generator (SSG)**: Docusaurus converts your React/Markdown files into static HTML at build time, then "hydrates" them back into an interactive React app at runtime. This provides fast loading, SEO-friendly pages that can be hosted anywhere.
